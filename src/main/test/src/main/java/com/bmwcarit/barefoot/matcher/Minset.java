     * Removes semantically redundant matching candidates from a set of matching candidates (as
     * {@link RoadPoint} object) and returns a minimized (reduced) subset.
     * <p>
     * Given a position measurement, a matching candidate is each road in a certain radius of the
     * measured position, and in particular that point on each road that is closest to the measured
     * position. Hence, there are as many state candidates as roads in that area. The idea is to
     * conserve only possible routes through the area and use each route with its closest point to
     * the measured position as a matching candidate. Since roads are split into multiple segments,
     * the number of matching candidates is significantly higher than the respective number of
     * routes. To give an example, assume the following matching candidates as {@link RoadPoint}
     * objects with a road id and a fraction:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li><i>(r<sub>i</sub>, 0.5)</i>
     * <li><i>(r<sub>j</sub>, 0.0)</i>
     * <li><i>(r<sub>k</sub>, 0.0)</i>
     * </ul>
     *
     * where they are connected as <i>r<sub>i</sub> &#8594; r<sub>j</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>i</sub>
     * &#8594; r<sub>k</sub></i>. Here, matching candidates <i>r<sub>j</sub></i> and
     * <i>r<sub>k</sub></i> can be removed if we see routes as matching candidates. This is because
     * both, <i>r<sub>j</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>k</sub></i>, are reachable from <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> Of course, <i>r<sub>j</sub></i> and <i>r<sub>k</sub></i> may be seen as relevant
     * matching candidates, however, in the present HMM map matching algorithm there is no
     * optimization of matching candidates along the road, instead it only considers the closest
     * point of a road as a matching candidate.
     *
     * @param candidates Set of matching candidates as {@link RoadPoint} objects.
     * @return Minimized (reduced) set of matching candidates as {@link RoadPoint} objects.
